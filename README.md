# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm [ @Brian-Karani], a passionate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Statistics. I'm deeply enthusiastic about the world of data analysis and have a particular fondness for programming with Python and R.

ðŸ’» My journey into the realm of data analysis has led me to explore the power of Python and R programming languages, where I've honed my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling. I'm constantly inspired by the potential of data to uncover insights and drive informed decision-making.

ðŸ“Š I'm also an avid explorer of data analytics tools like Power BI and Tableau, which I've used to create interactive dashboards and reports that bring data to life. It's incredibly rewarding to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that tell compelling stories.

ðŸŒŸ I'm excited to be on this learning journey and look forward to collaborating with others who share a passion for data analysis, statistics, Economics and programming.

Feel free to connect with me and explore some of my data-driven projects!
